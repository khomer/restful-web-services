	'<p>For years I had an enlarged thyroid with a fluid filled cyst. Although my thyroid functioned normally the enlargement sometimes made it difficult to swallow and constantly pressed on my windpipe. An endocrinologist put me on Synthroid to reduce the swelling but it had very little effect, plus I knew it depleted calcium. After my thyroid was aspirated, the size only went down about 30%. At that point the doctor recommended that I have it surgically altered, either reduced in size or completely removed. </p><h5>Then I found Dr. Allyn. I especially liked her Naturopathic approach of determining the cause and not just treating the symptom.</h5><p>She suspected I had an iodine deficiency, and the tests she performed proved she was right.

One day I called Dr. Allyn about another condition that had arisen. She answered my question about the newest predicament, but then she called me a few days later. Dr. Allyn had studied my huge file and saw that there was a &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; of sorts. She suggested that I be tested for Lyme disease. She had pieced the puzzle together correctly. I do have Lyme disease.</p><p>With this diagnosis, I made an appointment with an expert in auto-immune diseases, hoping that he would be of help. I was sadly mistaken. His conclusion was that there was nothing they could do for me. I would just have to live with the horrible things this disease can do.</p><p>Lucky for me, I had Dr. Allyn on my side. We were able to go outside the box, which was empty of options at this point.</p><p>At one point my body was so depleted that I did not have the energy to get out of bed.

She also put me in contact with another physician who was doing some new innovative laser treatment. People were coming to him from all over the world for Lyme disease and other illnesses. She went with me to see him so that we could both learn what he had to offer and how it would work.</p><h5>I am very happy to report that I was bedridden for a time, but now I am 90% back to normal.

       '<p>I am a 62 year-old male. For a period of almost 10 years, I have struggled with symptoms that got progressively worse and having Doctors repeatedly tell me they could find nothing wrong. One stated that I should be “thankful” for the shape I was in at my age. The only issues that seemed to consistently resurface in lab work was a deficiency in Vitamin D levels, which the Doctors addressed with advice to take an over-the-counter Vitamin D supplement, and some minor elevation in cholesterol levels (deemed typical for someone my age). However, taking Vitamin D supplements did not help with the deficiency.</p><p>I also struggled with weight issues, unable to get my weigh down into the 180 lb range from over 240 lbs. While I was already avoiding all the sugar, sugar substitutes and other bad things such as fried foods (those “evil” dietary no-no’s), this did not seem to help much. I tried two different &quot;Medi...&quot; programs in the area at great expense and loss of my personal time. While I realized small, short-term improvements in weight loss, 10-15 lbs. usually, I would reach plateaus below which nothing seemed to work. The weight would return as soon as I would leave the program, and the other symptoms (which I assumed were caused by the excessive weight) would never improve. Brain fog, digestive distress, weakness and feeling tired, loss of mental acuity, hair thinning, and skin aging problems were all slowly getting worse as the years passed. I felt like I was slowly being poisoned, but none of the Doctors I visited were of any help. Due to my age, 58 at the time, I did have a colonoscopy done which came back negative. The gastroenterologist had no explanation for the digestive issues I was having, despite my complaints and clear evidence to the contrary. I was getting very discouraged, because I knew something was very wrong. </p><p>Out of frustration, in December 2015 I began searching for medical studies that addressed the same symptoms I was realizing, and one thing kept surfacing again and again… problems with digestion related to gluten and its effects on body chemistry in general. As I researched further, the subject of “leaky gut syndrome” (intestinal permeability) seemed to also be associated with many of the symptoms from which I was suffering… again with its roots in gluten consumption. So, I began searching for a Doctor with expertise in these things in the greater Phoenix area and visited Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler. While she patiently and compassionately listened I shared my story with her, and we began a journey that has resulted in my feeling 20 years younger. </p><p>For the first 4-6 weeks, only minor change was noted. Then, almost suddenly, my weight started melting off at an amazing rate and my other symptoms began to improve. After about 6 months, I am now down almost 60 lbs to about 182 lbs (the same weight I was when I was in the Army 30 years ago!) without any change in exercise habits, without B-12 injections or other physical activity. My energy levels are much improved, and my mind is as sharp now as when I was in college (I am a computer scientist by trade). My digestion is back to normal, my lost hair is growing back, my skin looks much younger and I feel like a different person… all without taking any expensive (and potentially risky) prescription medications! Dr. Allyn also identified a genetic issue I have that addressed the Vitamin D deficiency, in that my body was unable to properly process Vitamin D (which is critical to good health) in the form commonly available as a over-the-counter supplement… something no other Doctor even considered checking over the years.</p><p>In short, I consider Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler a &quot;God-send&quot;. I cannot speak highly enough of both her genuine concern for me as a patient, and her technical competency. I no longer feel like my health is on a &quot;down-hill slide&quot; and I am looking forward to many more years of active and productive life with my wonderful wife. </p><p>I am now convinced that the foods we Americans commonly are &quot;sold&quot; in the stores and restaurants are a root cause of many American health issues. I am also convinced that Dr. Allyn is an exceptional healer, and worthy of my highest endorsement.</p>'

Past experience prompted Dr. Krieger-Fiedler to investigate whether or not gluten sensitivity may be the reason for the hyperactive immune system. Further testing confirmed her suspicions. I began a protocol of thyroid medication and a gluten free diet. All my symptoms soon started to resolve. After 8 months I was able to shed 30 pounds without starving myself.

She is a doctor that truly, deeply cares about helping her patients and will bend over backwards to provide all of the assistance you need.</p>'

       '<p>About four years ago, I was very frustrated with traditional medical doctors because they didn&apos;t address how awful I felt (like hitting a wall). Some of my problems were caused by Hashimoto&apos;s disease. I found Dr. Allyn, who really listened to what I told her and had me tested for several other possible conditions that could have contributed to the misery. Because of her thoroughness, I found I had gluten, dairy and corn intolerance in addition to the thyroid issue. Since changing my diet and thyroid medication, I have been feeling much more like I used to with enough energy to do my favorite hobbies. Thank you, Dr. Allyn!</p>'

        '<p>Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler is the epitome of physician as trusted teacher and healer. Her knowledge is vast and her compassion is boundless. She shares generously because she wants us to be empowered with knowledge and willing to take charge of our health. Over many years Dr. Allyn has assessed my health concerns, providing guidance and protocols that lead to improvement and sustained good health. In addition, I have been part of regular community gatherings where practices and information are shared across a broad range of health issues. Dr. Allyn&apos;s commitment to serving her community through the gift of her time and expertise is admirable in this information age when we are bombarded with conflicting and confusing guidance. Her calm demeanor is paired with her uncompromising commitment to truth and integrity. I have full confidence in her wisdom and advice as well as gratitude for her generosity and expertise. Dr. Allyn is a blessing beyond measure to her patients and community.</p>'

        '<p>Gastrointestinal Issues:</p><p>I have been a patient of Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler for the past four years. She is a very caring and knowledgeable Naturopathic Doctor. With her guidance and recommendations my health has improved greatly. She was able to clear a recurring case of pneumonia after my primary care physician prescribed a third round of antibiotics. I am approaching my third anniversary of no antibiotics, a record in my life. Dr. Allyn has convinced me on the benefits of a healthy digestive tract and increased immune system function.</p><p>Allyn has become a trusted friend and great support in many areas of my life. She understands and practices holistic medicine, knowing each of her patients is more than a collection of symptoms to be found and corrected. One thing I truly value is Allyn’s honesty. If she doesn’t know something I ask about she will tell me and either research it fully or provide options for help from other sources.</p>'

        '<p>Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler’s approach to her patient’s care is personal, comprehensive and responsive. She truly cares for her patients’ health and determining the core reason for a particular health problem.</p><p>Dr. Krieger-Fiedler has been the reason why I enjoy good health in my sixties. A few years ago I was not feeling well…lethargic and no energy. She determined that the problem was due to my low immune system, and immediately set forth in pumping that up. With supplements and diet, she had me begin a protocol with emphasis on my having a more balanced gut with good bacteria, rather than bad bacteria. It was successful and I felt like a new person.</p><p>I was again feeling very tired some years later and she determined that I was hypothyroid. I began a regimen of natural thyroid supplements and I’m on top of the world again. She has gained a reputation of being extremely knowledgeable in the area of thyroid hormone treatment. She has treated me successfully for a variety of symptoms, from estrogen replacement to clearing up a urinary tract infection, all with natural products. Although she uses natural protocols, alongside her treatment, she uses imaging and lab tests frequently to help her with her analysis of a problem.</p><p>I would wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Krieger-Fiedler. She is extremely knowledgeable, has a sharp and analytical intellect and is a “natural” in the Naturopathic field.</p>'

        '<p>Dr. Allyn was a breath of fresh air after several &quot;conventional&quot; medical doctors knew nothing about how to improve my declining health. I spent my new engagement and first part of my new marriage with too many awful symptoms to list. Dr. Allyn was able to diagnose Hashimoto&apos;s disease and adrenal fatigue and set me on the right path. She listened carefully and provided thoughtful suggestions on what to test and how to treat. We worked on increasing the diversity of my microbiome, changed to a natural thyroid med, made necessary diet/lifestyle changes, identified nutritional deficiencies and added vitamin/mineral supplementation. Dr. Allyn started me on a life-long journey of health through holistic healing. I will never go back to my &quot;old life&quot;. I am forever grateful to Dr. Allyn for sharing her knowledge and insight in such an empathetic way. She has a special way where she combines professionalism with a sweet personal touch. I highly recommend her!</p>'

I had huge sugar cravings and was over weight.</P><P>I met Dr. Allyn at an Iodine seminar that my sister was attending and I talked to her briefly, telling her I wanted to get healthy from the inside out and she thought she could help me and gave me her business card. I called her a couple of months later and we set up an appointment. She ordered several tests and after we got the results back she found an overgrowth of candida albicans and klebsiella pneumonia and no growth of lactobacillus. She also found that I was very low on iodine.</P><P>Dr. Allyn put together a custom prescription to treat the overgrowth of pathogens and to correct the lack of lactobacillus and iodine. It included a detox diet for a few weeks, continued by a yeast free diet following that and treating the pathogens. I had to have an ultrasound of my thyroid before I started taking the iodine supplement. That revealed some spots on my thyroid. Dr. Allyn said not to worry. The iodine should take care of that. We continue to monitor my thyroid with ultrasounds.</P><P>I then started the program that she had laid out for me. We retested in a few weeks and found some new organism which she treated. I continued on the program for about 8 or 9 months and then we found that the pathogens were gone but that I still had no lactobacillus. I will continue to take a custom probiotic for that for quite a while.</P><P>We also tested my thyroid function with blood work which revealed that I had Hashimoto’s disease. I started taking thyroid medication (Nature-Throid) for the Hashimoto’s disease.</P><P>I have now lost 13 pounds with the program Dr. Allyn prescribed for me and I have so much more energy since starting the Nature-Throid. I feel so much better and had no idea I had so many things going on in my body.</P><P>I had other issues during that year, like a cat bite that became infected. Dr. Allyn called me every day to see how I was doing. She also did research to see what other things I could do to help with the infection and healing other than the antibiotics I had to take. She has always been there when I needed her. I don’t know how I got along this long without her.</P><P>I continue to see Dr. Allyn and we plan to continue to see what other issues I may not know about, like possible food allergies and whatever we decide I need to check out based on any symptoms I may have.</P><P>Dr. Allyn thanks for always being there and for being my friend.</P>'

       '<p>Dr. Allyn has been an extremely knowledgeable and helpful guide on my path to wellness. I live overseas and am only in the Phoenix area for a few weeks out of the year, but she was willing to work with me and was very accommodating of my tight schedule. She recommended tests that I would have never been able to get from a traditionally trained Western physician. Between her listening skills and the tests that she subsequently ordered, we had the necessary information that was needed to improve my health. She also follows up with me online to see how I am progressing and we have had consultations via Skype when necessary.</p><p>I am very pleased with the care and compassion that she has for her patients and I am grateful that I decided to see her. One appointment with her going over the test results, gave me more information than I had gotten in seeing regular doctors over the last 20 plus years. I wish I had known about naturopathic medicine and Dr. Allyn sooner!</p>'
